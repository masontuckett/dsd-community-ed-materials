## Notes

This course is comprehensive—though instruction will strictly follow the [instructional schedule](intro-to-cybersecurity/instructional-schedule.xlsx). 

Content is broad—intentionally designed to provide an overview of practical cybersecurity. 

Pedantic details such as the CIA triad are excluded so as to not overwhelm students; the material is structured around those principles.

The majority of content will not be covered under youth age groups—as it is arranged around adult scheduling and learning expectations.

### Reflection

Pedagogical flow and substance are ultimately aimed towards CTE/CC programs.

It is not maximalist in the sense that I will not overburden students, and "*comprehensive*" sections may be skipped during instruction.

*This is ultimately scaffolding material for my portfolio—serving as a base for my other courses, and eventual secondary instruction.*
